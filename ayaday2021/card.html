            <p>Aya,</p>
            <p>Happy Happy Birthday! youve been alive for 22 years now and honestly im so proud of you. youve managed to not trip and fall on your xacto knife and that is GROWTH. thank god bc I was running out of bandaids</p>
            <p>(graduating soon has me all nostalgic, get ready) </p>
            <p>I just wanna say thank you for all the memories these last four years. I still remember how for my very first exam freshman year, I was stressing my heart out. I mentioned to you off-handedly how I skipped lunch to study, and you MARCHED over to the PCL and actually BROUGHT me a PB&J sandwhich. I knew then that I struck GOLD with the kindest idiot roommate. </p>
            <p>You've been by my side the whole time and made college so fun, memorable, and fulfilling. I don't let people in that easily but I'm thankful u somehow snuck ur way in :) We've both grown so much since our freshie Jester years but I know no matter what I can still count on u (and u know i always got your back too- just lmk and I'll chuck some chocolate icecream your way)</p>
            <p>I'm really going to miss you in cali- you HAVE to visit me bro, i'll have my own comfy couch for you by then hehehe. I cant wait for all the memories you'll make next year, it's going to be a BLAST just be sure to keep me in the loop and spill all the tea with me (as ur og roomie i legally get dibs)!!</p>
            <p>hope u had a very very happy belated birthday aya</p>
            <br><p>-Neeti</p>
            <p>(omg also I had too much fun on this site hehhe i finally was able to unleash my extra-ness)</p>
